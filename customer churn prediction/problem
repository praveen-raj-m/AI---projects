This project is about customer churn prediction.
Churn quantifies the number of customers unsubscribing/canceling the service.In this project, we would like to build a model which can help us identify the intention of customers to leave us in future.

To solve the problem of predicting customer churn, we will analyze the past data to study the characteristics/behaviour of the customers before they churned.

The dataset we will be using is Telcom Customer Churn Dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
